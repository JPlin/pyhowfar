* Pytorch version of 'How far are we from solving the 2D \& 3D Face Alignment problem? (and a dataset of 230,000 3D facial landmarks)'

  For official torch7 version please refer to [[https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment-training][face-alignment-training]]

  This is a reinplement of training code for 2D-FAN and 3D-FAN decribed in "How far" paper. Please visit [[https://www.adrianbulat.com][author's webpage]] or [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07332][arxiv]] for technical details.

  Thanks for bearpaw's excellent work on human pose estimation [[https://github.com/bearpaw/pytorch-pose][pytorch-pose]] . And in this project, I reused a branch of helper function from pytorch-pose.

  Pretrained models are available soon.

** Requirments

   - pytorch >= 0.4
   - torchvision
   - tensorboardx
   - matplotlib
   - scikit-image
   - tqdm

** Setup

   1. Clone the github repository and install all the dependencies mentiones above.

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git  clone https://github.com/hzh8311/pyhowfar
     cd pyhowfar
   #+END_SRC

   2. Download the 300W-LP dataset from the authors webpage. In order to train on your own data the dataloader.lua file needs to be adapted.

   3. Download the 300W-LP annotations converted to t7 format by paper author from [[https://www.adrianbulat.com/downloads/FaceAlignment/landmarks.zip][here]], extract it and move the ```landmarks``` folder to the root of the 300W-LP dataset.

** Usage

   In order to run the demo please download the required models available bellow and the associated data.

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     python main.py
   #+END_SRC

   In order to see all the available options please run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash 
     python main.py --help
   #+END_SRC

** What's different?

   - Pythoner friendly and there is no need for `.t7` format annotations
   - Add 300-W-LP test set for validation.
   - Followed the excatly same training procedure described in the paper (except binary network part).
   - Add model evaluation in terms of **Mean error**, **AUC@0.07**
   - TODO: add evaluation on test sets (300W, 300VW, AFLW2000-3D etc.).
